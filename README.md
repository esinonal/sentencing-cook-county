Question: Were certain demographics more harshly sentenced in Cook County from 2000-2020?

The topic of race has come up numerous times in the current political climate. With the BLM movement gaining traction, we wanted to figure out if their complaints about the justice system being unfair to African-Americans had a basis. We thought that using the Chicago sentencing dataset would be a good choice because it has significant black and white neighborhoods (Chicago is around 45% White and 30% Black).

We wanted to look at whether certain demographics were more harshly sentenced in Cook County from 2000-2020. We looked at the racial groups of black and white, and contrasted prison sentence length for six separate crimes: (1) first-degree murder, (2) possession of a controlled substance, (3) aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol, (4) armed robbery, (5) aggravated unlawful use of weapon, and (6) identity theft. These sentence lengths were compared with a Wilcoxon rank sum test because the distribution was not normal.

We found that, for (2) possession of a controlled substance, (3) aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol, (4) armed robbery, and (6) identity theft, one must reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between sentence lengths. Of these crimes with statistically significant differences, only aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol had whites sentenced longer than blacks. The remaining three showed blacks being sentenced longer.
